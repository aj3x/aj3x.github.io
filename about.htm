<h4>Alexander Russell</h4>
As I'm sure you've guessed, my name is Alexander Russell. I live in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.
I recently graduated from the University of Saskatchewan with a degree in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics. 
I enjoyed programming from an early age and still enjoy the ease of use and freedom of creation that it provides.
