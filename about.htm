<h2>About Me</h2>
My name is Alexander Russell. I live in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.
I am a recent graduate of the University of Saskatchewan with a degree in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics. 
I have enjoyed programming from an early age and still enjoy the ease of use and freedom of creation that it provides.

I enjoy continually improving myself and hope to work in an environment that facilitates that.
I spend my spare time hiking, swimming, playing tennis and squash, among other things.
