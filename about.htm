<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
My name is Alexander Russell.
I am a recent graduate of the University of Saskatchewan with a degree in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics. 
I am looking for a career that would facilitate my passion for learning and help me to grow as a developer.
</p>
I am a driven, easygoing individual who enjoys programming, whether it be with others or on my own.
When I'm not working I spend my spare time, hiking, swimming, playing tennis and video games.
