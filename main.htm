<h2>Hello World!</h2>
<p>Welcome to my Angular website! This is my careful creation and experimentation for all things web.
    This contains a bit about myself and projects that I've worked on.
    It is still in development as I learn more AngularJS and experiment with which features I want to add.

<p>I also have a more polished <a href="https://aj3x.ca" title="Please ask for your parents permission before going online">temporary site</a> hosted by WordPress.</p>
