<h5 id="Dwarves">The Dwarves at Hielthe Mine</h5>
<p>
    Unity game developed by my team and myself in CMPT 406. Utilized Agile methodologies with two week sprints.
    The game is procedurally generated using Perlin noise for resources and terrain. Caves are generated using cellular
    automaton with events, resources, and enemies scattered around the cave. The AI uses nav meshes to get around with only
    select areas around the player, towncenter, and outposts being generated dynamically.
    I worked on numerous aspects of the game throughout development. The majority of my time was spent on AI, NavMesh, terrain
    generation, resource generation, and improving efficiency of the entire system.

<h5 id="BomberBoy">Bomber</h5>
<p>Bomberman replica with networked mobile multiplayer and Facebook and Twitter integration. 
    Features semi-destructible environment, room for up to 4 networked players, and easy to use mobile controls. 
    My work consisted of programming the environment and players, as well as integrating the game with the network team.
