                    We developed a chaotic cooperative game where players try to fight the forces of nature as they attempt to
                    direct the "Mothership" that they are all tied together to.
                    Everything put into the game was developed by the team from code to drawings to sound.
                    I acted as testing and QA tester, as well as developing code for the ships, UI, and pair programming with other members of the team.

                    My team and I developed this game for our Game Design Workshop class(CMPT 406). 
                    We decided on creating a procedurally generated game wthat focused on interactions with NPCs.
                    We developed the game using Unity and utilized Agile methodologies. 
                    We met twice a week, once for our daily standups and the other for any questions, integrating issues, and as a general work period.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game is procedurally generated using Perlin noise for resources and terrain. 
                    Caves are spawned on the map and can be entered. We used cellular automaton to create the interiors. 
                    From here we scattered events, resources, and enemies around the cave. 
                    There are two main oppenents the player faces weather and elemental penguins. 
                    The penguins spawn during extreme weather and attack whichever character is in range.
                    The player is given a grace period before this to allow them to develop their town center to help defend against them.
                    The AI uses dynamic nav meshes to get around.
                    To reduce the system load, only selected areas are generated dynamically around: player, towncenter, and outposts.
                    <br>
                    I worked on numerous aspects of the game throughout development. The majority of my time was spent on AI, NavMesh, terrain
                    generation, resource generation, and improving efficiency of the entire system.
                    As well I helped team members design, develop, and integrate their code into the project.
                    Overall the team worked diligently and spent many weekends fixing unforseen problems and efficiency issues.
                    The final result was presented at Bartari to the general public and did well for itself.

                    This project was an enlightening experience for me as it was my first experience leading a team.
                    I learnt a lot about managing a team, prioritization of features, and facilitating communication between teammates.
                    After the GameJam, I repaired a number of sections of code that we didn't have time to fix.

                    Problem put forth by our Artificial Intelligence professor for a custom game.
                    The game is an asymmetric, turn based, two player game.
                    Our challenge was to develop the game and an AI to play it. 
                    I first tested a few methods of storing in Python to compare their read and write times.
                    Unsurprisingly dictionaries are very fast in Python.
                    From here we developed the backend for the game, a Minimax search, testing, AlphaBeta pruning, and more testing.

                    Pawns was a custom game of chess proposed by our professor.
                    In this game two players control a set of five pawns that follow the basic rules of pawns:
                    can move one space forward if it is empty, can attack pawns on the forward diagonols.
                    I both designed and developed the whole program in Python.
                    <br>
                    I started with programming the game itself and developing a system to play it manually.
                    From here I then expanded this system to include all possible moves a player may have.
                    I then developed a metric to measure a board's current state and terminal states.
                    Using Mini-Max I tested a number of basic states and expanded on the system to include depth limits.
                    After more testing I added AlphaBeta pruning and continual testing.

                    An assignment for my Artificial Intelligence course.
